This repository contains the codes (written in Matlab format) of 8 unsupervised link predictors (and their corresponding weighted version) used in LPSF model (Link Prediction using Social Features) and 2 diffusion-based link prediction models: LPDP (Link Prediction using Diffusion Pro- cess) and LPDM (Link Prediction using Diffusion Maps).

**************************************************************************************************
8 unsupervised link predictors include:

- Preferential Attachment (PA);
- Adamic/Adar (AA);
- Common Neighbors (CN);
- Resource Allocation Index (RA)
- Jaccard's Coefficient (JC), 
- PropFlow 
- Inverse Path Distance
- PageRank
